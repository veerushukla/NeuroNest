                <p style="color: black;">NeuroNest is a wearable ecosystem designed to boost cognitive performance
                    naturally through
                    AI-personalized micro-learning, biofeedback, and neurostimulation. It's like a "Fitbit for your
                    brain," combining neuroscience research with adaptive learning technology to help users learn
                    faster, focus better, and retain information longer.</p>

                    <li>Smart Learning Pulses: The wearable uses safe, non-invasive neurostimulation to prime the brain
                        for optimal focus before study or work sessions.</li>
                    <li>Micro-Learning Drops: AI curates bite-sized, 2â€“5 minute lessons tailored to your goals
                        (languages, math, leadership skills) and inserts them during ideal brain states detected via EEG
                        sensors.</li>
                    <li>Focus Guardian: Real-time feedback alerts users when they are losing concentration, suggesting
                        breaks or guided breathing.</li>
                    <li>NeuroCycles: Personalized routines that combine light neurostimulation, learning sessions, and
                        short recovery periods to accelerate mastery of new skills.</li>
                    <li>Sync Across Devices: Works with VR headsets, AR glasses, or just your phone for immersive
                        mini-learning experiences.</li>
